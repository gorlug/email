## Prerequistes

 - docker
 - docker-compose

Modify the following files:
 - copy `env.template` to `config/env` and modify

Add the following files:
 - config/TLS/chain.pem
 - config/TLS/cert.pem
 - config/TLS/ssl_certificate.pem
 - config/TLS/ssl_private_key.pem

If they do not exist a self signed certificate will be created.

## Run

```
./create.sh hostname
```

Check go to the web interface (http://conainer_ip:80), get the salts, and put them in the `salts` file.

Everything should be up and running.

## Backup

To backup, just run the `BACKUP` in your folder and you should be good!

## OpenDKIM

Run the `add_domain.sh` script inside the postix container, and configure your DNS, you should be fine!

## Add a mailbox

You can find a script [here](https://github.com/IndiePaaS/IndiePaaS/blob/master/utils/add_mailbox.sh)

## Contributing

If you have any issue (something not working, mail marked as spam, missing doc), please do report an issue here! Thanks

This system is used in production at [IndieHosters](https://indiehosters.net/) so it is maintained. If you use it, please tell us, and we'll be really happy to update this README!

You can help us by:
 - starring this project
 - sending us a thanks email
 - reporting bugs
 - writing documentation/blog on how you got up and running in 5mins
 - writing more documentation
 - sending us cake :) We loove cake!

## TODO
 - documentation for TLS for the web (reverse proxy FTW!)
 - separate processes in postfix (one process/container! damn!)
 - postfix/dovecot - try to sync install instructions with mailinabox

Heavily inspired by [mail-in-a-box](https://mailinabox.email/)! Thanks to the amazing work they produced. It is the best up to date `how to` for email hosting out there :)
